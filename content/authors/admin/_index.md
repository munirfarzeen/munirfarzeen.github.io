I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Mobile Robotics Lab, Aalto University under the mentorship of Professor [Tomasz Kuncer ](https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/tomasz-kucner). My research is centred around the development of socially-aware autonomous vehicles. The primary objective is to create vehicles that can accurately predict the intentions of pedestrians while simultaneously communicating their own intentions effectively to pedestrians. The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles in urban environments. By understanding and anticipating the actions of pedestrians, autonomous vehicles can proactively adjust their driving behaviour to avoid accidents and ensure smoother interactions with pedestrians.

Previously I finished my PhD at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea and worked on developing data-driven methods for autonomous vehicle perception using unconventional sensors, for instance, event and thermal cameras.
